Reusable snippets are a powerful feature that allows you to write content once and reuse it across your documentation. This is a great way to ensure consistency and to save time and effort.

## Creating a Snippet

To create a snippet, simply create a new MDX file in the `snippets` directory. The name of the file will be the name of your snippet.

## Using a Snippet

To use a snippet in your documentation, simply use the `<Snippet>` component and pass in the name of the snippet as the `file` prop.

```mdx
<Snippet file="snippet-intro.mdx" />
```

## The Power of Snippets

Snippets are a great way to:

-   **Ensure Consistency:** Ensure that your documentation is consistent and up-to-date.
-   **Save Time:** Save time and effort by writing content once and reusing it across your documentation.
-   **Improve Maintainability:** Make it easier to maintain your documentation by centralizing your content in one place.
