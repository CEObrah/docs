## Overview

We believe that it is important to be transparent about the risks, limitations, and ethical considerations of our platform.

## Risks & Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Policy Drift">
    As our platform learns from user feedback, there is a risk that the behavior of our agents could drift away from their intended purpose. We mitigate this risk through a combination of continuous monitoring, regression testing, and human-in-the-loop review.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Retrieval Brittleness">
    Our platform's ability to provide accurate, evidence-based answers is dependent on the quality of the knowledge sources that it is connected to. We mitigate this risk by working closely with our customers to ensure that their knowledge sources are well-structured and up-to-date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Evaluation Leakage">
    There is a risk that our evaluation process could "leak" information to our agents, allowing them to "cheat" on our benchmarks. We mitigate this risk through a variety of techniques, including the use of a separate, held-out test set for our final evaluations.
  </Accordion>

## Ethics

We are committed to the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence.
