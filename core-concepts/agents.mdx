The MindLab platform is a coordinated ecosystem of specialist agents. Each agent is a typed specialist, with a clear, machine-readable contract that specifies its capabilities, constraints, and operational parameters.

## Agent Types

There are three main types of agents in the MindLab platform:

-   **Planner Agents:** These agents are responsible for decomposing high-level objectives into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of smaller, well-defined sub-tasks.
-   **Solver Agents:** These agents are responsible for executing the core tasks in a workflow. They may call multiple tools and services to get the job done.
-   **Reviewer Agents:** These agents are responsible for checking the work of the solver agents against a predefined quality rubric. They can also be used to enforce consistency and to flag errors or hallucinations.

## The Agent Lifecycle

Agents in the MindLab platform go through a lifecycle that is similar to the lifecycle of a human employee.

1.  **Provisioning:** Agents are provisioned from the Expert Registry.
2.  **Configuration:** Agents are configured to meet the specific needs of a team or a project.
3.  **Execution:** Agents execute tasks as part of a workflow.
4.  **Evaluation:** The performance of agents is continuously evaluated.
5.  **Deprovisioning:** Agents are deprovisioned when they are no longer needed.
