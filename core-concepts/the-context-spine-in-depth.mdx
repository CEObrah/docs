description: "A detailed look at the stateful architecture and memory tiers that power the MindLab platform."

MindLab is a stateful system by design. Unlike stateless tools that suffer from corporate amnesia, our platform is built on the Context Spine, a sophisticated architecture for managing knowledge and memory across your entire organization.

## Evidence-First Retrieval

The foundation of the Context Spine is an "evidence-first" approach. Before an agent acts, it performs a planning-aware query against the available knowledge sources. This ensures that all actions are grounded in verifiable data, and all outputs are accompanied by source-linked citations.

## Memory Tiers

The Context Spine is not a monolithic database; it is a tiered system designed to provide the right level of context at the right time.

-   **Scratchpads:** Ephemeral, short-term memory used by an agent during the execution of a single task.
-   **Session Memory:** Context that persists for the duration of a single user session.
-   **User/Team Memory:** Durable memory that is scoped to a specific user or team.
-   **Durable Summaries:** Periodically, the system synthesizes the most important information from the other memory tiers into durable summaries.
