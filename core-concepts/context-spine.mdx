MindLab is a stateful system by design. Unlike stateless tools that suffer from corporate amnesia, our platform is built on the Context Spine, a sophisticated architecture for managing knowledge and memory across your entire organization.

Have you ever had to re-explain the same thing to a chatbot multiple times? This frustrating experience is the hallmark of a stateless AI. It has no memory of past interactions, so every conversation starts from a blank slate.

### The Power of Persistent Memory

A stateful AI is a game-changer for enterprise workflows.

-   **It Remembers Your Preferences:** You can tell a MindLab agent your preferences once, and it will remember them in all future interactions.
-   **It Understands Your Projects:** As you work on a project, the AI builds a rich contextual understanding of the key players, deadlines, and objectives.
-   **It Learns from Your Feedback:** If you correct an agent's output, it learns from that feedback and will not make the same mistake again.

### A Compounding Knowledge Asset

This persistent memory does more than just improve the user experience. It transforms your AI from a simple tool into a compounding knowledge asset.

As your teams interact with the MindLab platform, they are collectively building a powerful, evolving model of your institutional knowledge. This asset grows more valuable over time, driving continuous improvement and unlocking new efficiencies across your entire organization.

## Evidence-First Retrieval

The foundation of the Context Spine is an "evidence-first" approach. Before an agent acts, it performs a planning-aware query against the available knowledge sources. This ensures that all actions are grounded in verifiable data, and all outputs are accompanied by source-linked citations.

## Memory Tiers

The Context Spine is not a monolithic database; it is a tiered system designed to provide the right level of context at the right time.

-   **Scratchpads:** Ephemeral, short-term memory used by an agent during the execution of a single task.
-   **Session Memory:** Context that persists for the duration of a single user session.
-   **User/Team Memory:** Durable memory that is scoped to a specific user or team.
-   **Durable Summaries:** Periodically, the system synthesizes the most important information from the other memory tiers into durable summaries.
