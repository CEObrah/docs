The MindLab platform is designed to be a collaborative environment where teams can work together to achieve their goals.

## Creating a Team

To create a new team, simply navigate to the "Teams" tab in your workspace settings and click the "New Team" button. You will be prompted to provide a name and a description for your team.

## Managing a Team

Once you have created a team, you can manage its members and permissions from the MindLab dashboard.

-   **Members:** Add and remove members from your team.
-   **Permissions:** Define granular permissions for each member of your team. You can control who has access to which agents, data sources, and workflows.

The MindLab platform is more than just a place to manage your work. It is a collaborative environment that is designed to help your team to succeed.

-   **Shared Workspaces:** Work together in shared workspaces.
-   **Shared Memory:** Share knowledge and context with your team.
-   **Shared Workflows:** Collaborate on complex workflows.
