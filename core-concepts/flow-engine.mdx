title: "The Flow Engine"
description: "A deep dive into the deterministic, stateful execution layer that provides enterprise-grade guarantees."
---

Underpinning the Orchestrator and the Context Spine is the Flow Engine, the stateful execution layer that ensures every workflow is executed with precision, predictability, and resilience.

The Flow Engine is designed to provide enterprise-grade guarantees about the state of your AI-driven work. It is not a "best-effort" system; it is a deterministic engine that provides full control over side effects and enables powerful debugging and auditing capabilities.

## Core Architectural Features

  <Card title="Deterministic DAGs" icon="diagram-project">
    Every workflow is executed as a deterministic Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) or state machine.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Guarded Side Effects" icon="shield-halved">
    Any interaction with external systems is treated as a guarded side effect.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time-Travel Debugging" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    The stateful nature of the Flow Engine allows for replays and diffs of workflow executions.
