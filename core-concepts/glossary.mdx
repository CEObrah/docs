## Key Terms

**Agent:** A typed specialist, with a clear, machine-readable contract that specifies its capabilities, constraints, and operational parameters.

**CADANCE™:** A declarative, version-controlled contract that defines the entire lifecycle of an AI-driven workflow. It stands for Config, Agents, Data, Analysis, Norms, Controls, and Execution.

**Context Spine:** A tiered memory system that provides evidence-first, personalized, and continuous context for AI agents.

**Control Plane:** The "brain" of the system. The Orchestrator reads the CADANCE™ spec, resolves policies, discovers experts, and orchestrates workflows.

**Data Plane:** The "hands" of the system. The specialist agents (experts) retrieve domain knowledge from the Context Spine, read and write to memory tiers, call external tools and services, and produce outputs.

**Evaluation Loop:** A continuous process for ensuring the quality, alignment, and improvement of the MindLab platform.

**Expert Registry:** A curated marketplace of specialist AI agents.

**Flow Engine:** A deterministic, stateful execution layer that provides enterprise-grade guarantees for AI-driven workflows.

**Golden Tasks:** A curated set of representative tasks with known correct outputs, used for regression testing.

**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** A checkpoint in a workflow where a human is required to provide input or approval.

**Orchestrator:** The runtime Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) engine that acts as the brain of the system, deciding who does what, when, and how.

**Runtime Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** An approach to AI that involves composing multiple smaller, specialized agents at runtime, rather than relying on a single, monolithic model.
