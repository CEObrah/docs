MindLab is an organizational intelligence layer that sits between intent and impact. It coordinates the work behind the work.

## How it works

A runtime mixture of experts factorizes objectives into atomic tasks and routes each task to the best specialist under policy, budget, and memory.

## Components

-   **Orchestrator:** The brain of the system.
-   **Expert Registry:** A curated marketplace of specialist agents.
-   **Context Spine:** A tiered memory system.
-   **Flow Engine:** A deterministic, stateful execution layer.
-   **Evaluation Loop:** A continuous process for ensuring quality.
-   **Controls:** A suite of robust controls for safety, stability, and auditability.
