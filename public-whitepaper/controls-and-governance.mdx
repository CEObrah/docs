The MindLab platform is designed for the rigors of a production enterprise environment. We provide a suite of robust controls that ensure every AI-driven workflow is executed with safety, stability, and complete auditability.

-   **Budgets:** Define granular budgets for cost and latency.
-   **Data Stance:** Your organization retains full ownership of all your data.
-   **Audit:** Every action taken by the system is recorded in a tamper-evident log.
-   **HITL Checkpoints:** For mission-critical tasks, you can insert human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints.
