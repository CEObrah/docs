Modern enterprises are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, yet the returns remain elusive. A 2025 study by MIT Media Lab’s Project NANDA found that only 5% of custom enterprise AI projects reach production and deliver meaningful value. This “AI Implementation Gap” is characterized by high adoption but low transformation.

MindLab closes this gap by delivering a runtime mixture-of-experts (MoE) platform that acts as an organizational intelligence layer. Instead of a monolithic, stateless model, MindLab factorizes user intent into atomic tasks and routes each task to the best specialist agent using policies, budgets and real-time signals.

The results are measurable. Early pilots show reductions in unit cost and time-to-value while increasing success rates.
