| Retrieval Brittleness | Curated sources, human review, and feedback loops. |
| Evaluation Leakage & Gaming | Held-out evaluation sets, randomized sampling, and multi-metric evaluation. |
| Bias & Fairness | Fairness checks in evaluation metrics and counterfactual testing. |
| Privacy & Consent | Explicit consent for data storage and deletion/anonymization of memories. |
