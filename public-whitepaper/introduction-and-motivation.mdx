The enthusiasm around generative AI tools has produced an explosion of pilots and demos. Yet the majority of these efforts fail to cross the pilot-to-production chasm. This is the AI Implementation Gap.

Key limitations of typical AI deployments include:

-   **Memorylessness:** Popular chatbots forget context from one interaction to the next.
-   **Misaligned workflows:** AI agents built for demos do not integrate with business processes.
-   **Lack of auditability:** Without deterministic behavior and logging, it is impossible to reconstruct why a given output was produced.

MindLab was architected to address these failings. Four principles guide its design:

-   **Config over vibes**
-   **Runtime Mixture-of-Experts**
-   **Durable Memory**
-   **Audited Execution**
