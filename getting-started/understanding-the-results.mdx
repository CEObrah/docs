When the MindLab Orchestrator completes your request, it will deliver the results in the chat interface. The platform is designed to provide outputs that are not only accurate, but also transparent and auditable.

### Evidence-Based Answers

Every output from the MindLab platform is evidence-based. This means that the system does not "make things up." Instead, it synthesizes information from the approved knowledge sources that have been connected to your workspace.

### Source-Linked Citations

To ensure full transparency, every key statement in an agent's output is accompanied by a source-linked citation. You can click on these citations to see the exact source document that the information was drawn from.

This "evidence-first" approach is a core tenet of our design philosophy. It provides you with the confidence to trust the outputs of the system and to use them in your most mission-critical workflows.

### Providing Feedback

Once you have reviewed the results, you can provide feedback to the system.

-   **Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down:** Let us know if the result was helpful.
-   **Corrections:** Directly edit the output to refine it.

This feedback is a critical part of the MindLab ecosystem. It is used to continuously improve the performance of the system, ensuring that your intelligence layer gets smarter over time.
