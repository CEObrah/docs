Welcome to MindLab. This guide will walk you through a powerful example of how to leverage the MindLab platform to automate a complex, high-value business workflow: **creating a competitive analysis report.**

This is not a task for a single AI. It requires a coordinated team of specialist agents, and your role is simply to state the objective. The Orchestrator will handle the complex work of assembling the team and managing the workflow.

### Step 1: State Your High-Level Objective

From the MindLab chat interface, state your goal in natural, outcome-oriented language.

**For example, you could type:**

> "I need a competitive analysis for our upcoming product launch, 'Project Phoenix.' Focus on the top three competitors in the enterprise SaaS space, and I need to understand their pricing models, key features, and recent marketing campaigns."

### Step 2: Observe the Orchestrator in Action

Once you submit your request, the Orchestrator will begin to factorize your intent into a series of sub-tasks and assemble a team of specialist agents.

You will see real-time updates as the Orchestrator engages agents like:

-   **A `Market Research` agent** to identify the top three competitors.
-   **A `Data Retrieval` agent** to gather public data on their pricing, features, and marketing.
-   **A `Strategic Analyst` agent** to synthesize this data and identify key insights.
-   **A `Report Generation` agent** to structure the findings into a professional document.

This is the power of a runtime Mixture-of-Experts system. You state the "what," and the Orchestrator figures out the "how."

In the next guide, we will explore the rich, evidence-based results of this workflow.
