The best way to understand the power of the MindLab platform is to have a conversation with one of our AI agents. This guide will walk you through the process of having your first conversation.

## Step 1: Choose Your Agent

The first step is to choose the agent you want to talk to. You can see a list of all the agents that have been provisioned for your workspace in the "Agents" tab of the MindLab dashboard.

## Step 2: Start the Conversation

Once you have chosen your agent, you can start the conversation by simply typing a message in the chat interface.

## Step 3: State Your Objective

Your role is simply to state your objective in natural language. The Orchestrator will handle the rest.

<Tip>
You can express your requests in high-level, outcome-oriented language. For example, instead of saying, "Summarize the text at URL X, then analyze its sentiment," you can simply say, "Tell me what's important about this article and how I should feel about it."

## Step 4: Review the Results

The final output will be delivered to you in the chat interface, complete with source-linked citations and a full audit trail.
