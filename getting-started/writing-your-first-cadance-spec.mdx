The CADANCE™ spec is the heart of the MindLab platform. It is a declarative, version-controlled contract that defines the entire lifecycle of an AI-driven workflow.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of writing your first CADANCE™ spec.

## Step 1: Define Your Objective

The first step is to define the high-level objective of your workflow. For this tutorial, we will create a simple workflow that analyzes the sentiment of a piece of text.

## Step 2: Define Your Agents

Next, we will define the agents that will be involved in the workflow. For this simple workflow, we will only need one agent: a "SentimentAnalyzer".

## Step 3: Define Your Data

Next, we will define the data that will be used in the workflow. In this case, the data will be the text that we want to analyze.

## Step 4: Define Your Analysis

Next, we will define the analysis that will be performed on the data. In this case, we will simply output the sentiment of the text.

## Step 5: Putting It All Together

Here is the complete CADANCE™ spec for our simple workflow:

```yaml
Config:
  objective: "Analyze the sentiment of a piece of text."
Agents:
  - role: "SentimentAnalyzer"
Data:
  text: "I love MindLab!"
Analysis:
  output: "{{SentimentAnalyzer.sentiment}}"
