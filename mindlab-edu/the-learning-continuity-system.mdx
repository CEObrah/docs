MindLab EDU is the modern operating layer for schools: one place that gives leaders clear visibility, saves teachers time, and keeps parents engaged—while quietly building the data foundation to expand into a full school ERP over time.

### The Problem We Solve

-   **Leaders** lack timely, trustworthy roll-ups of critical data.
-   **Teachers** juggle a dozen different tools, and content lives in disconnected silos.
-   **Parents** want clarity, but schools cannot scale one-to-one updates.

Existing ERPs are heavy and expensive. Point AI tools are not sticky. MindLab EDU is the solution.

### Our Wedge: High-Impact, Low-Friction

We start with a tight wedge of three high-impact, low-friction modules that deliver immediate value:

1.  **Admin Insight:** Real-time dashboards for enrollment, attendance, and at-risk students.
2.  **Teacher Workspace:** An AI-assisted workspace to generate materials, auto-grade, and send summaries.
3.  **Parent View:** A secure portal for attendance, grades, and messages.

This wedge creates immediate value and centralizes the school’s content and activity in MindLab, forming a data moat for our expansion into a full, modular school ERP.
