MindLab EDU is the modern operating layer for schools: one place that gives leaders clear visibility, saves teachers time, and keeps parents engaged—while quietly building the data foundation to expand into a full school ERP over time.

## The Problem We Solve

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="For Leaders" icon="user-tie">
    You lack timely, trustworthy roll-ups of critical data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Teachers" icon="user-pen">
    You juggle a dozen different tools, and content lives in disconnected silos.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Parents" icon="family">
    You want clarity, but schools cannot scale one-to-one updates.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Existing ERPs are heavy and expensive. Point AI tools are not sticky. MindLab EDU is the solution.

## Our Wedge: High-Impact, Low-Friction

We start with a tight wedge of three high-impact, low-friction modules that deliver immediate value:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Admin Insight">
    Real-time dashboards for enrollment, attendance, and at-risk students.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Teacher Workspace">
    An AI-assisted workspace to generate materials, auto-grade, and send summaries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parent View">
    A secure portal for attendance, grades, and messages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
This wedge creates immediate value and centralizes the school’s content and activity in MindLab, forming a data moat for our expansion into a full, modular school ERP.
