title: "Personal AI Agents with Memory"
description: "The core differentiator of the MindLab EDU platform is a persistent, personal AI agent for every user."
---

Every student, teacher, parent, and administrator on the MindLab EDU platform gets their own dedicated AI agent—an always-on, context-aware copilot that remembers everything it’s learned about them and their world.

<Note>
This is not a stateless chatbot. It is a persistent intelligence that accumulates memory over time: past conversations, decisions, feedback, goals, preferences, performance signals, and curriculum context. This memory is used proactively to ensure that every interaction is informed, continuous, and personalized.

## What the Personal AI Agent Does for Each Role

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Student Agent">
    Remembers what you have struggled with, your learning goals, and your preferred learning style. If you ask about "fractions" again, the agent knows what was already tried, what worked, and where the confusion persisted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The Teacher Agent">
    Remembers your grading preferences, past feedback language, and class-level patterns. It can suggest lesson adjustments or feedback drafts that are aligned to that evolving context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The Parent Agent">
    Remembers what updates you find helpful and what concerns you’ve raised before. It tailors summaries and coaching tips so they’re not redundant or overwhelming.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The Admin Agent">
    Tracks institutional goals, previously flagged risks, and the effectiveness of past interventions. It helps synthesize trends, reminding you of what was decided and what follow-up actions were deferred.
