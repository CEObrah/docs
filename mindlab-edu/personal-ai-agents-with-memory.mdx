Every student, teacher, parent, and administrator on the MindLab EDU platform gets their own dedicated AI agent—an always-on, context-aware copilot that remembers everything it’s learned about them and their world.

This is not a stateless chatbot. It is a persistent intelligence that accumulates memory over time: past conversations, decisions, feedback, goals, preferences, performance signals, and curriculum context. This memory is used proactively to ensure that every interaction is informed, continuous, and personalized.

### What the Personal AI Agent Does for Each Role

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The Student Agent">
    Remembers what the student has struggled with, their learning goals, and their preferred learning style. If a student asks about "fractions" again, the agent knows what was already tried, what worked, and where the confusion persisted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The Teacher Agent">
    Remembers grading preferences, past feedback language, and class-level patterns. It can suggest lesson adjustments or feedback drafts that are aligned to that evolving context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The Parent Agent">
    Remembers what updates the parent finds helpful and what concerns they’ve raised before. It tailors summaries and coaching tips so they’re not redundant or overwhelming.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The Admin Agent">
    Tracks institutional goals, previously flagged risks, and the effectiveness of past interventions. It helps synthesize trends, reminding leadership of what was decided and what follow-up actions were deferred.
