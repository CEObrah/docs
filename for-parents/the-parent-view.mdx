The MindLab platform is designed to be a collaborative tool that brings together students, teachers, and parents. As a parent, you will have a dedicated view into your child's learning journey, with real-time updates and actionable insights.

## Your Parent Dashboard

The parent dashboard is your central hub for all things related to your child's education. From here, you can:

-   **View Progress:** See your child's progress against their learning objectives.
-   **Review Work:** Review your child's completed assignments and the feedback they have received.
-   **Communicate with Teachers:** Send and receive messages from your child's teachers.

## A Partnership in Learning

We believe that education is a partnership between the school and the home. The MindLab platform is designed to facilitate this partnership by providing you with the information and tools you need to support your child's learning.
