## Your Personal AI Agent

Your personal AI agent is your single point of contact for understanding your child's academic journey. You can ask it questions in plain English, and it will provide you with a natural-language summary that is grounded in your child's actual performance data.

<Info>
**For example, you could ask:**

> "How is my child doing in science?"

**And your agent might respond:**

> "Sheâ€™s improving in fractions but still missing word problems; I recommend 15 minutes of practice this weekend."
