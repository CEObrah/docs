## 10.1 Overview

MindLab can be deployed as a fully managed cloud service, a self-hosted installation or an air-gapped deployment. Operational excellence, scalability and visibility are first-class concerns.

## 10.2 Deployment Modes

- **Cloud:** Multi-tenant environment where workspaces and data are isolated.
- **Self-Hosted:** Organizations deploy MindLab on their own infrastructure.
- **Air-Gapped:** Fully isolated environment with no external network access.

## 10.3 Scaling & Infrastructure

MindLab uses a microservices architecture with autoscaling worker pools. Key aspects:

- **Autoscaling:** Based on queue depth, CPU/GPU utilization and budgets.
- **Backpressure:** If downstream agents or tools are saturated, the orchestrator slows intake.
- **Caching:** Results of expensive retrievals or computations are cached.
- **Service Mesh:** Mutual TLS and circuit breakers isolate failures and enforce security.

## 10.4 Observability & SRE Hooks

MindLab integrates with standard observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry). Operators have access to:

- **Metrics:** Detailed metrics for routing time, agent usage, success rates, etc.
- **Traces:** Distributed traces for each run.
- **Alerts:** Preconfigured alerts for failures, timeouts, budget overruns, etc.
- **Dashboards:** Customizable dashboards per workspace or domain.

## 10.5 Failure Modes & Mitigations

- **Deployment Failure:** Incomplete upgrades or misconfigurations. Mitigation: blue/green deployment, canary releases, rollback on error.
- **Scaling Failure:** Capacity insufficient for spike. Mitigation: autoscaling; queue backpressure.
- **Observability Blind Spots:** Lack of metrics or logs. Mitigation: instrumentation requirements enforced in CI/CD.

## 10.6 Metrics & SLOs

- **Uptime:** Target > [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] % across all deployment modes.
- **Deployment Time:** < [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] hours for new versions.
- **Mean Response Time:** < [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] ms for API requests.

## 10.7 Key Takeaways

- MindLab offers flexible deployment modes to meet compliance and scalability requirements.
- Autoscaling, backpressure, caching and service mesh techniques enable reliable operations at enterprise scale.
- SRE hooks provide the visibility needed for production readiness.
