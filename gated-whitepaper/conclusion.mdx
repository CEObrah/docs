MindLab addresses the critical gap identified in MIT’s 2025 report: most AI initiatives fail because they forget context, don’t learn and can’t scale to production. By combining a runtime mixture-of-experts orchestrator with a declarative CADANCE™ specification, durable memory and continuous evaluation, MindLab provides the infrastructure needed to turn AI pilots into operational systems. It transforms prompts into reproducible workflows, monolithic models into networks of specialists, and static conversations into evolving relationships.

## Call to Action

- **Join our Early Access Program:** We are seeking design partners to pilot MindLab in new domains.
- **Contribute Benchmarks:** We welcome collaboration on building public benchmark corpora and evaluation rubrics.
- **Advance the Research:** Researchers can explore runtime MoE routing algorithms, memory summarization, and evaluation strategies within the MindLab framework.
