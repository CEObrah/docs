## 9.1 Overview

The MindLab platform is designed for the stringent requirements of enterprise deployment—privacy, compliance and operational safety. Controls and governance are built into every component, ensuring that AI workflows respect organizational policies and regulatory obligations.

## 9.2 Budgets and Throttling

Every CADANCE™ spec includes cost and latency budgets at multiple levels—plan, role and step. The orchestrator and flow engine enforce these budgets.

## 9.3 Data Stance and Privacy

MindLab adopts a strict data stance:

- **Ownership:** Data belongs to the organization. MindLab does not use customer data to train foundation models.
- **Residency & Isolation:** Workflows can be deployed in the cloud, on-premises or air-gapped.
- **Differential Access:** RBAC ensures that agents only access data they are permitted to.

## 9.4 Audit & Logging

Every run produces a tamper-evident log. Each entry includes: timestamp, actor, input and output, citations, policy decisions, and signatures.

## 9.5 Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Checkpoints

Certain steps may require human approval. The Norms section of CADANCE™ defines when a HITL checkpoint should be inserted.

## 9.6 Failure Modes & Mitigations

- **Budget Overrun:** The system halts the workflow and reports an error.
- **Policy Violation:** Attempted data access or action outside of norms triggers an immediate halt and alert.
- **Compromise:** If an agent behaves maliciously or is compromised, the orchestrator revokes its credentials and routes tasks to alternatives.

## 9.7 Metrics & SLOs

- **Policy Enforcement Latency:** < [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] ms.
- **Audit Log Integrity:** Percentage of logs verified without tampering.
- **Incident Response Time:** Time from policy violation detection to human notification.

## 9.8 Key Takeaways

- MindLab embeds budgets, RBAC, audit logs and HITL checkpoints into every workflow.
- Data remains under the organization’s control.
- Tamper-evident logs and differential access provide compliance with GDPR, FERPA and other regulations.
