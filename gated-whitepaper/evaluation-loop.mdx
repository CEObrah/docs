## 8.1 Overview

AI systems degrade without feedback. The Evaluation Loop continuously measures outputs, detects regressions and shapes routing/gating policies. Unlike retraining a foundation model, the evaluation loop uses golden tasks, rubrics and adversarial review to adjust policies and agent selection at runtime.

## 8.2 Design Rationale

Three problems require a continuous evaluation mechanism:

- **Quality Control:** Without measurements, errors accumulate and remain undetected.
- **Alignment:** AI outputs must align with organizational objectives.
- **Improvement without Retraining:** Policy-driven systems can improve by adjusting routing and gating.

## 8.3 Components

- **Golden Tasks:** Representative tasks with known correct outputs.
- **Rubric Scorers:** Domain-specific scoring functions that evaluate outputs.
- **Adversarial Review:** Separate reviewer agents generate challenging inputs and try to find failure modes.
- **Policy Shaping:** Evaluation results feed back into the orchestrator’s policy engine.

## 8.4 Mechanism

Evaluation runs happen at two levels:

- **Pre-deployment:** Before a CADANCE™ spec is promoted to production, golden tasks are run to ensure no regressions.
- **Post-deployment:** In production, a fraction of traffic or synthetic tasks are diverted to evaluation.

## 8.5 Failure Modes & Mitigations

- **Evaluation Leakage:** Evaluation prompts may leak into training or agent behavior. Mitigation: maintain a held-out set of golden tasks.
- **Metric Gaming:** Agents may optimize for evaluation scores without improving real outcomes. Mitigation: use a diverse set of metrics and adversarial tests.

## 8.6 Metrics & SLOs

- **Regression Pass Rate:** Target > [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] % across golden tasks.
- **Evaluation Latency:** < [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] ms for scoring a task.
- **Policy Update Frequency:** How often routing policies are updated based on evaluation signals.

## 8.7 Key Takeaways

- Continuous evaluation ensures quality, alignment and improvement without retraining base models.
- Golden tasks, rubrics and adversarial review provide a comprehensive assessment of system performance.
- Policy shaping turns evaluation into actionable adjustments in the routing and gating engine.
