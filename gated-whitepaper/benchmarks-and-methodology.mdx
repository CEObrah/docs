## 11.1 Overview

To evaluate MindLab rigorously, we define a transparent benchmark methodology aligned with real business outcomes. The benchmarks measure unit cost, quality, consistency, time-to-value and robustness across domains.

## 11.2 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Unit Cost per Solved Task:** Total cost divided by number of tasks solved.
- **Success Score:** Weighted composite of rubric scores, citation quality and user satisfaction.
- **Variance under Budget:** Variability of cost and latency relative to the budgets specified in CADANCE™.
- **Time-to-Value (TTV):** Time from initial specification to a production deployment producing value.
- **Regression Pass Rate:** Percentage of golden tasks passing evaluation when new specs or agents are introduced.

## 11.3 Benchmark Tasks

Benchmarks span multiple domains to reflect MindLab’s versatility:

- **Education (Assessment Loop):** Generate, grade and give feedback on student assessments.
- **HR (Candidate Screens):** Extract competencies from résumés, conduct structured interviews and rank candidates.
- **Legal/Compliance (Clause Review):** Identify clauses in contracts, flag risks and draft modifications.
- **Research (Literature Synthesis):** Retrieve relevant papers, summarize findings, identify gaps and propose methods.

## 11.4 Benchmark Protocol

- **Fixed CADANCE™ Specs:** Each task uses a canonical spec.
- **Seed Control:** Deterministic seeds are used for generation steps.
- **Data Sets:** Publicly available or synthetic data sets are used.
- **Trace Bundles:** The complete run logs are archived and can be replayed.

## 11.5 Failure Modes & Mitigations

- **Benchmark Overfitting:** The system may learn patterns specific to the benchmark tasks. Mitigation: hold out a set of evaluation tasks.
- **Data Leakage:** Training on benchmark data. Mitigation: use clearly delineated training and evaluation sets.

## 11.6 Metrics & SLOs

- **Reproducibility:** At least 95% of runs should reproduce results within tolerance when re-executed.
- **Benchmark Publishing Frequency:** Benchmarks updated every 6 months with new tasks and data sets.

## 11.7 Key Takeaways

- MindLab benchmarks focus on end-to-end outcomes, not just model accuracy.
- Tasks span multiple domains, highlighting the platform’s versatility.
- Transparent protocols, public specs and trace bundles enable independent replication and evaluation.
