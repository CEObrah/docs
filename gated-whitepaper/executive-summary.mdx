title: "Executive Summary"
description: "MindLab is the intelligence layer for modern work, solving the AI Implementation Gap by providing a runtime mixture-of-experts orchestrator governed by CADANCE™."

Modern enterprises are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, yet the returns remain elusive. A 2025 study by MIT Media Lab’s Project NANDA found that only 5% of custom enterprise AI projects reach production and deliver meaningful value, while the remaining 95% languish as pilots that never scale. This “AI Implementation Gap” is characterized by high adoption but low transformation—more than 80% of organizations have experimented with tools like ChatGPT, yet fewer than 20% have moved beyond experiments to real pilots and just 5% have achieved operational impact. The root cause, according to the report, is that most systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context or improve over time.

MindLab closes this gap by delivering a runtime mixture-of-experts (MoE) platform that acts as an organizational intelligence layer. Instead of a monolithic, stateless model, MindLab factorizes user intent into atomic tasks and routes each task to the best specialist agent using policies, budgets and real-time signals. Every user—student, teacher, parent, manager or executive—gets their own persistent AI agent with durable memory that accumulates knowledge across sessions, projects and applications. The behavior of these agents is defined declaratively via CADANCE™—a specification for Config, Agents, Data, Analysis, Norms, Controls and Execution. Tasks are therefore reproducible, auditable and aligned with corporate governance.

The results are measurable. Early pilots show reductions in unit cost and time-to-value while increasing success rates. By routing tasks to the right specialist and grounding answers in evidence, MindLab delivers:

- **Unit cost per solved task:** ↓ [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] % relative to baseline single-agent workflows.
- **Task success score:** ↑ [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] points on rubric-scored goldens.
- **Time-to-value:** ↓ [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] weeks from concept to production.

MindLab is being tested first in education, where personalized tutoring, continuity of support across teachers, proactive risk detection and institutional reporting illustrate its power. However, the architecture generalizes across HR onboarding, legal clause review, research synthesis and other complex workflows. This whitepaper details the motivation, design, components and roadmap of the platform.
