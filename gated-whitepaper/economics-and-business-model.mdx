## 13.1 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

MindLab’s business model emphasizes clarity and alignment with value. The TCO for a workspace includes:

- **Infrastructure & Model Costs:** Compute for running agent models, retrieval indexes, and the orchestrator; storage for knowledge and memories; and network egress.
- **Operations:** Administrative overhead for configuring CADANCE™ specs, managing agents and monitoring workflows.
- **License:** A per-workspace subscription.

## 13.2 Pricing Structure

- **Workspace Subscription:** Each workspace pays a fixed monthly subscription that includes a generous usage envelope.
- **Enterprise Controls:** Optional add-ons for advanced RBAC, cross-workspace governance and additional compliance features.
- **Domain Packs:** Base subscription includes core packs. Specialized packs can be purchased separately.

## 13.3 ROI Calculation

Customers can estimate ROI by comparing baseline time and cost for a given workflow with the MindLab-enabled workflow. Savings include reduced manual labor, improved outcomes, and risk avoidance.
