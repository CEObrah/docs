## 5.1 Overview

The Expert Registry maintains the ecosystem of specialist agents available to MindLab. Each expert is a micro-service or model encapsulating a specific capability. The registry allows the orchestrator to query, filter and rank experts for a given task.

## 5.2 Design Rationale

Centralizing expertise solves several problems:

- **Specialization:** Each expert can be optimized independently.
- **Extensibility:** New capabilities can be added without modifying existing agents.
- **Governance:** Policies and constraints are attached to experts, enabling fine-grained control.

## 5.3 Typed Specialists

Each expert entry includes:

- **ID and Role:** Human-readable name and role.
- **Capability Vector:** A vector or set of tags describing tasks the expert can perform.
- **Tool Affordances:** A list of external tools the expert is authorized to call.
- **Safety Constraints:** Policies dictating disallowed actions.
- **Load Discipline (Quotas):** Rate limits, concurrency restrictions and backpressure signaling.

## 5.4 Directed Skill Graph

The registry organizes experts into a graph rather than a flat list. Nodes represent agents; edges encode prerequisite relationships or fallback chains.

## 5.5 Eligibility Resolution

When the orchestrator requests a candidate set for a sub-task, the registry filters agents in two phases:

- **Hard Filters:** Agents must satisfy policy constraints (RBAC, data boundaries) and capability requirements.
- **Soft Priors:** Among eligible agents, ranking is based on historical success, calibrated confidence, estimated cost, latency and other signals.

## 5.6 Data/Interfaces

The registry exposes gRPC/REST endpoints:

- `ListExperts(role_filter, capability_filter)`
- `GetExpert(id)`
- `RegisterExpert(metadata)`
- `UpdateExpertStats(id, result, cost, latency)`

## 5.7 Failure Modes & Mitigations

- **No Suitable Agent:** If no agent meets hard constraints, the orchestrator escalates to a human reviewer or a generic fallback agent.
- **Agent Unavailability:** An expert may be temporarily offline or overloaded. Mitigation: backpressure signals and dynamic fallback to other agents.

## 5.8 Key Takeaways

- The Expert Registry allows MindLab to maintain a diverse ecosystem of specialists.
- Organizing experts as a graph enables complex dependency resolution and fallback strategies.
- Hard and soft filtering provide a balance between strict policy compliance and performance optimization.
