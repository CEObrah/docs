## 6.1 Overview

The Context Spine provides an evidence-first, tiered memory system. It fuses domain knowledge with multi-level memory so that agents reason with the right facts at the right time. Most generative AI systems suffer from amnesia: they forget earlier interactions and cannot ground answers in verified sources. The Context Spine solves this by combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector indexing, summarization and cross-turn coherence.

## 6.2 Design Rationale

Key goals of the Context Spine:

- **Evidence-first:** Every answer must be backed by verifiable information.
- **Personalization:** Each user has unique context and memory.
- **Continuity:** Context persists across sessions.
- **Auditability:** Memories and retrieval results are stored and versioned.

## 6.3 Retrieval Strategies

MindLab uses hybrid retrieval:

- **Vector Search:** Documents, notes, conversations and data entries are embedded into a high-dimensional space.
- **Keyword/Metadata Filtering:** Policy and context filters narrow the search.
- **Planning-Aware Retrieval:** The orchestrator uses the CADANCE™ plan to generate specific search queries.
- **Citation Tracking:** Each retrieved passage carries metadata.

## 6.4 Memory Tiers

MindLab organizes memory into four tiers:

- **Scratchpad:** Short-lived, per-task memory.
- **Session Memory:** Persists for the duration of a conversational session.
- **User/Team Memory:** Durable memory scoped to a user or a team.
- **Durable Summaries:** Periodically, the system synthesizes high-value information into summaries.

## 6.5 Cross-Turn Coherence and Reviewers

To maintain coherence across turns, MindLab uses a Reviewer agent that monitors conversation state.

## 6.6 Data/Interfaces

The Context Spine exposes APIs for retrieval, memory, summarization, and citation enumeration.

## 6.7 Failure Modes & Mitigations

- **Stale Data:** Memories or knowledge bases may become outdated. Mitigation: scheduled refreshes and diff-based notifications.
- **Privacy Breach:** Sensitive data may be exposed in retrieval results. Mitigation: policy filters and manual redaction.
- **Over-Personalization:** Agents may overfit to user preferences. Mitigation: randomization and periodic resets.

## 6.8 Metrics & SLOs

- **Retrieval Latency:** < [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] ms per query.
- **Citation Coverage:** Fraction of agent outputs that include valid citations (target > [METRIC_PLACEHOLDER] %).
- **Memory Consistency:** Number of contradictions detected by the reviewer per 100 interactions.

## 6.9 Key Takeaways

- MindLab’s Context Spine marries retrieval-augmented generation with durable memory.
- Memory is tiered: scratchpads, sessions, user/team and long-term summaries.
- Reviewers enforce coherence across turns, preventing hallucination and ensuring traceability.
