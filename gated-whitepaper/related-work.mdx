## 14.1 Training-Time vs Runtime Mixture-of-Experts

Large language models have adopted training-time MoE architectures. While powerful, they are rigid. MindLab’s runtime MoE moves the gating and routing outside the model, allowing for greater flexibility and control.

## 14.2 Agentic Frameworks

Open-source agentic frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex and Semantic Kernel enable developers to build agent chains. MindLab builds on these ideas but adds enterprise-grade features: persistent memory, CADANCE™ specs, evaluation loops, auditing and multi-tenant deployment.

## 14.3 Retrieval Systems & RAG

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems fuse search with language models. MindLab’s Context Spine adds planning-aware queries, multi-tier memory and cross-turn coherence, addressing limitations of standard RAG systems.

## 14.4 Evaluation Toolchains

Platforms like EvalLLM, Ragas and Hart evaluate LLM outputs against test suites. MindLab’s Evaluation Loop extends these with continuous evaluation, adversarial review and policy shaping.
