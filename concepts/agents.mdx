The MindLab platform is a coordinated ecosystem of specialist agents. Each agent is a typed specialist, with a clear, machine-readable contract that specifies its capabilities, constraints, and operational parameters.

## Agent Types

There are three main types of agents in the MindLab platform:

-   **Planner Agents:** These agents are responsible for decomposing high-level objectives into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of smaller, well-defined sub-tasks.
-   **Solver Agents:** These agents are responsible for executing the core tasks in a workflow.
-   **Reviewer Agents:** These agents are responsible for checking the work of the solver agents against a predefined quality rubric.
