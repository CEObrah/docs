MindLab is not a one-size-fits-all solution. We understand that every industry has its own unique set of challenges and workflows. That's why we have created a series of domain packs, pre-built solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of your industry.

## What is a Domain Pack?

A domain pack is a collection of pre-built components that are designed to accelerate your AI journey.

-   **Specialist Agents:** A team of specialist AI agents that have been trained on the specific language and workflows of your industry.
-   **CADANCE™ Specs:** A set of pre-built CADANCE™ specs for common use cases in your industry.
-   **Data Connectors:** A set of pre-built data connectors for the most popular data sources in your industry.

## Available Domain Packs

-   **Education:** Our flagship "EDU Pack" is a complete solution for K-12 and higher education. We are currently piloting this pack with a select group of partners.

## Coming Soon

We are actively working to expand our offerings to other industries. The following domain packs are currently in development:

-   **HR:** A suite of tools for talent acquisition, onboarding, and employee engagement.
-   **Legal/Compliance:** A set of tools for contract analysis, e-discovery, and compliance monitoring.
-   **Research:** A suite of tools for literature synthesis, experimental design, and data analysis.
