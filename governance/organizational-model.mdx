The MindLab platform is designed to be a flexible and scalable solution that can be adapted to the unique needs of your organization. At the core of this flexibility is a powerful organizational model that allows you to define the roles, responsibilities, and relationships of all the users in your system.

## The User Hierarchy

The MindLab organizational model is a hierarchical system that is designed to mirror the structure of your organization.

-   **Organization:** The top-level container for all of your users, workspaces, and data.
-   **Workspace:** A dedicated environment for a team or a project.
-   **User:** An individual user account.

## Roles and Permissions

The MindLab platform includes a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system that allows you to define granular permissions for each user in your organization.

-   **Administrator:** Has full access to all workspaces and settings.
-   **Manager:** Can manage users and workspaces.
-   **User:** Can access and interact with the agents and workflows in their assigned workspaces.
