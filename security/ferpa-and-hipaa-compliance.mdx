We understand that our customers in the education and healthcare sectors are subject to a unique set of regulatory requirements. The MindLab platform has been architected from the ground up to meet the stringent security and privacy standards of both FERPA and HIPAA.

### FERPA

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The MindLab EDU platform is fully FERPA compliant.

-   **Data Ownership:** Your institution retains full ownership of all student data.
-   **Access Control:** Our granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system ensures that only authorized users have access to student records.
-   **Auditability:** Every action taken on the platform is recorded in a tamper-evident log, providing a complete and immutable audit trail.

### HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law that protects the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI). The MindLab platform is HIPAA compliant.

-   **End-to-End Encryption:** All PHI is encrypted at rest and in transit.
-   **Strict Access Controls:** Our RBAC system ensures that only authorized users have access to PHI.
-   **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs):** We will sign a BAA with all of our healthcare customers.

We are committed to helping our customers meet their compliance obligations. If you have any specific questions about our compliance program, please do not hesitate to contact us.
