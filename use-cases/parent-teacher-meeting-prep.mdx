## The Challenge

Parent-teacher meetings are often repetitive, unfocused, and teachers scramble to explain context. This can lead to unproductive conversations and a lack of alignment between home and school.

## The MindLab EDU Solution

The platform provides both teachers and parents with the tools they need to come to every meeting prepared, aligned, and ready to have a productive conversation.

### A More Productive Conversation

The platform's personal AI agents can provide both teachers and parents with a concise, data-driven summary of a student's progress, including:

    -   **Learning Goals:** The student's current learning goals and their progress towards achieving them.
    -   **Suggested Talking Points:** A list of suggested talking points and discussion items for the meeting.

  <Accordion title="For Parents">
