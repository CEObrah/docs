## The Challenge

Generic, one-size-fits-all help doesn’t stick. Students get confused because the support they receive is not aware of what they’ve already struggled with or what the class is actually covering.

## The MindLab EDU Solution

The platform provides every student with their own personal AI tutor. This is not a generic chatbot; it is a sophisticated learning partner that is deeply integrated with the student's unique learning journey.

### A Tutor That Knows the Student

The personal AI tutor is connected to the student's [personal AI agent](/mindlab-edu/personal-ai-agents-with-memory), which means it has a rich, evolving understanding of the student's needs.
