The MindLab platform provides a suite of tools for customer operations and support. Our platform is designed to help you to resolve customer issues faster, to improve customer satisfaction, and to identify the root causes of customer problems.

## Problems Solved

-   **Ticket Backlog:** Reduce your ticket backlog and improve your response times.
-   **Inconsistent Resolutions:** Ensure that all of your customers receive a consistent and high-quality experience.
-   **No Root-Cause Loop:** Identify the root causes of customer problems and take action to prevent them from happening again.

## Agents

-   **Triage Router:** A specialist agent that can automatically triage and route incoming tickets.
-   **Agent Assist:** A specialist agent that can provide real-time assistance to your support agents.
-   **Macro Builder:** A specialist agent that can help you to create and manage a library of macros.
-   **QA Reviewer:** A specialist agent that can review the work of your support agents and provide feedback.
-   **RCA Analyst:** A specialist agent that can analyze customer support data to identify the root causes of customer problems.

## Workflows

-   **Auto-triage & intent routing; agent assist suggestions inline.**
-   **Knowledge base drafts from solved tickets; macro governance.**
-   **Complaint clustering → product RCA → Jira backlog.**
