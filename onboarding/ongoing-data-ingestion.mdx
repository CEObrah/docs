While our white-glove onboarding process is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, we understand that your data is not static. That's why we've made it easy for you to add new data to the platform on an ongoing basis.

## The Data Ingestion Process

From the "Admin Settings" section of your dashboard, you will see an option to "Upload New Data." This will take you to a secure portal where you can upload your data in a variety of formats.
