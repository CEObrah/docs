The MindLab platform is not a static system; it is a living intelligence layer that is constantly learning and adapting. A key part of this learning process is the ongoing ingestion of new data.

## Your Data, Your Control

We believe that your data is your most valuable asset. That's why we have designed our platform to give you full control over the data ingestion process.

-   **Connect to Any Source:** Connect to a wide variety of data sources, including databases, APIs, and local files.
-   **Schedule Your Ingestions:** Schedule your data ingestions to run on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
-   **Monitor Your Ingestions:** Monitor the status of your data ingestions from the MindLab dashboard.

## A Continuously Improving System

By keeping your intelligence layer up-to-date with the latest data, you can ensure that your AI agents are always working with the most accurate and relevant information. This is a key part of our commitment to continuous improvement.
