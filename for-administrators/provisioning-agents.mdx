As a MindLab administrator, you have the power to provision your organization with a diverse team of specialist AI agents. This is a simple but powerful process that allows you to tailor the capabilities of the platform to the specific needs of your business.

### Step 1: Procure Your Domain Packs

The first step is to procure the [Domain Packs](/governance/domain-packs) that are relevant to your organization. This is done from the "Admin Settings" section of the MindLab dashboard.

You can browse our marketplace of curated Domain Packs and add them to your organization's library.

### Step 2: Provision Agents to a Workspace

Once you have procured a Domain Pack, you can provision its agents to a specific workspace.

From the "Workspace Management" view, select the workspace you want to manage, and you will see an option to "Provision Agents." This will allow you to select from your library of procured Domain Packs and make the agents within them available to all the teams in that workspace.

### Step 3: Scope Agent Capabilities

For granular control, you can apply policies to scope the capabilities of the agents within a workspace. For example, you might want to restrict a "Financial Analyst" agent to only access data from a specific set of sources.

This powerful governance model ensures that your teams have access to the AI capabilities they need, while you maintain full control over security and compliance.
