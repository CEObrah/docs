The MindLab platform is not a single AI; it is a coordinated ecosystem of specialist agents. As an administrator, you have the ability to provision and manage the agents that are available to your team.

## The Expert Registry

The Expert Registry is a curated marketplace of specialist AI agents. Each agent in the registry has been rigorously tested and evaluated by the MindLab team to ensure that it meets our high standards for quality and reliability.

## Provisioning an Agent

To provision a new agent, simply navigate to the "Agents" tab in your workspace settings and click the "Add Agent" button. You will be presented with a list of available agents from the Expert Registry.

## Managing Agents

Once you have provisioned an agent, you can manage its configuration and monitor its performance from the MindLab dashboard.

-   **Configuration:** Configure the agent to meet the specific needs of your team.
-   **Performance:** Monitor the agent's performance against key business metrics.
-   **Permissions:** Define which members of your team have access to the agent.
