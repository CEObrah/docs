A workspace is a dedicated environment for a team or a project. It is a container for all of your data, agents, and workflows.

## Creating a Workspace

To create a new workspace, navigate to the "Workspaces" tab in the MindLab dashboard and click the "New Workspace" button. You will be prompted to provide a name and a description for your workspace.

## Configuring a Workspace

Once you have created a workspace, you can configure it to meet the specific needs of your team.

-   **Data Sources:** Connect your workspace to a variety of data sources, including databases, APIs, and local files.
-   **Agents:** Provision a team of specialist AI agents from the Expert Registry.
-   **Permissions:** Define granular permissions for each member of your team.

## Managing Workspaces

The MindLab dashboard provides a centralized location for managing all of your workspaces. From here, you can monitor the performance of your agents, track your usage, and manage your billing.
