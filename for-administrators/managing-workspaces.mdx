As a MindLab administrator, you have granular control over every aspect of your organization's intelligence layer. The "Workspace Management" view in your dashboard is your central hub for this control.

### Managing Teams

Within each workspace, you can create and manage teams. Teams are typically aligned with specific projects or initiatives. You can create new teams, add or remove users from existing teams, and assign team leads.

### Managing Users & Roles

You can invite new users to your organization and assign them to specific teams and roles. The [Organizational Model](/governance/organizational-model) provides a detailed overview of the available roles and their permissions.

### Managing Policies

Policies are a powerful tool for ensuring that your AI operations are always aligned with your organizational goals and compliance requirements.

From the "Workspace Management" view, you can apply policies that:

-   **Restrict Data Access:** Ensure that agents only have access to the specific data sources they need to do their job.
-   **Set Budgets:** Define cost and latency budgets for specific workflows or teams.
-   **Define Approval Workflows:** Require human-in-the-loop approval for certain types of tasks.

This comprehensive suite of management tools provides you with the confidence and control you need to deploy AI at scale.
